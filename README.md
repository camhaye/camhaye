<h3>Bonjour ! My name is Camille but you can call me Cam !</h3>
<h5>I used to be a primary-school-teacher and now am a Fullstack Developer</h5>
✒️ For over ten years, I've been involved in online collaborative writing (fiction).<br>
💻 As well as developing excellent writing skills, this experience has enabled me to learn to code in HTML, CSS and Javascript.<br>
🚂 An avid coder, I chose to take the Le Wagon Bootcamp course as part of a professional reconversion, in order to find a working environment that matches my aspirations and values.<br>
