<h3>Hey ! My name is Camille but you can call me Cam !</h3>
For over ten years, I've been involved in online collaborative writing (fiction). As well as developing excellent writing skills, this experience has enabled me to learn to code in HTML, CSS and Javascript. An avid coder, I chose to take the Wagon Bootcamp course as part of a professional reconversion, in order to find a working environment that matched my aspirations and values.<br>
